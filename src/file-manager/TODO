BROKEN
* Not all resources are freed when item is removed from list
* Check that we ref all those things we need to
* Adding new covers on the left is not working
* Very rapid scrolling in one direction or another - scrolling to a given item
* Mouse clicking sometimes rotates items in the wrong direction
* Focus is lost to the nautilus window
* Static internal functions should all take priv as argument, not coverflow
* Make cover item attribute calculations dynamic. No more static array lookups

NOT IMPLEMENTED
* [Nautilus] Selection following on list and clutter widget
* Scrolling to a certain item
* Clearing the coverflow
* Animation for moving into a directory
* Launching Gloobus-Preview
